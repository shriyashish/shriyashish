I'm currently learning to make AR/VR environments via Unity and Blender. 
I show keen interests in Deep Learning, AR/VR and Cybersecurity.
I'm always eager to learn new technologies and domains and not restrict myself from exploring. 
I would love to collaborate on projects and discuss recent trends and so on!
