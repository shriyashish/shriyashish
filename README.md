Firstly, thank you for visiting my Github Profile. 

I'm Shriyashish Mishra, an undergraduate IT student. 

I believe in the Binary World of 0 and 1 as it makes such an important synergy together, not only in digital world but also in real world.

I'm currently learning to make AR/VR environments via Unity and Blender. 
I show keen interests in Deep Learning, AR/VR and Cybersecurity.
I'm always eager to learn new technologies and domains and not restrict myself from exploring. 
I would love to collaborate on projects and discuss recent trends and so on!
