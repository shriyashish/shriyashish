Firstly, thank you for visiting my Github Profile. 

I'm Shriyashish Mishra, an undergraduate IT student caught up in Aristotle's theory of dualism. Looking forward to a third dimension that might change the whole base of the current digital world!

I'm currently learning to make AR/VR environments via Unity and Blender. 
I show keen interests in Deep Learning, AR/VR and Cybersecurity.
I'm always eager to learn new technologies and domains and not restrict myself from exploring. 
I would love to collaborate on projects and discuss recent trends and so on!
